# Exploring Prosper Loan Data
## Haya Aldawood


## Dataset

> I choose the Prosper loans data to conduct the analysis required for this project. Prosper is a peer-to-peer lending marketplace and each row represents one loan posting with 81 variables. The only modification I did on this dataset was one quality issue the cases of the letters of the columns. 


## Summary of Findings

> - Most borrowers choose not to disclose their information.
>-Term length is found to be less of a key variable when investors choose to invest in a loan.
>- Prosper rating is found to be a key variable when investors choose to invest in a loan. In a sample of loans the attracts the highest number of investors, the highest number on the rating scale which is 7 seems to be favorable among investors. which suggests that the higher the rating the more likely a particular loan will attract investments.



## Key Insights for Presentation

> The concealment of some information such as the borrower's occupation may suggest the some of the loans are fake. Further investigation on a sample of loans that did not attract any investment may confirm this theory. Lenders by nature will avoid investments that appear to be untrustworthy.
